# Lesson 18: useRef Hook

This lesson demonstrates how to use the `useRef` hook in React to reference DOM elements and persist mutable values across renders.

## Key Concepts

- Using `useRef` to access and manipulate DOM nodes
- Storing mutable values that do not trigger re-renders
- Common use cases: focusing input fields, storing timers, etc.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

Explore the code and try interacting with the demo to see how `useRef` works in practice.
